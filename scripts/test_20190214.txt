Test procedure:

Setup:
1. Power up wifi router
2. Power up drone

3. Connect laptop to wifi router
	- check ip address 192.168.1.147
	- if changed, modify in ~/.bashrc

4. Ping drone 192.168.1.170

5. ssh into drone 
	$ ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.170
	password: ubuntu

6. in drone, launch dji_sdk
	$ roslaunch dji_sdk sdk.launch

7. on laptop, test topics
	$ rostopic list

8. test for gps
	$ rostopic echo /dji_sdk/gps_health 
	data = 5 is best

9. test for take off and landing
	$ rosrun my_dji test_takeoff_land.py 

10. test for velocity control
	Note which direction the drone moves to. 
	$ rosrun my_dji test_move_around.py 
	1. take off
	2. z+ go up
	3. x+ forward
	4. x- reverse
	5. y+ left
	6. y- right
	7. yaw+ ccw
	8. yaw- cw

11. collect data for sonar
	on drone;
	$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
	$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
	make sure data is there;
	$ rostopic echo /ultrasound

12. manually take off and hover at a certain height < 3.5 m. prefereably 2 m

13. republish sonar reading on laptop
	$ rosrun topic_tools relay ultrasound ultrasound_2

14. ON DRONE record bag
	$ rosbag record --all

DONE. 


RESULT:
- take off and landing ok.
- try to make landing smoother. maybe slowly go to height 1m, then call landing. 
- speed of 0.5 m/s is ok
- when yaw+; when turning seems fine, but when braking, it goes down almost until ~1m above ground
- then when yaw-; it goes up again. 
- sometimes the altitude fluctuates quite a lot when moving in x / y direction. Myabe need a better altitude control.
